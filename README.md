Issues & Pull Requests
----------------------

I welcome all bug reports, questions, suggestions and pull requests - I'd say most of the content that this mod has to offer is based on discussion and suggestions, and so is a crucial and exciting part of development. I will try to reply as quickly as possible, but keep in mind that I am very busy some parts of the year any may be rather inactive during these times.


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any Minecraft mod I make means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code, excluding any bundled APIs from other mods (which are covered by the respective licenses in their packages), is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft/blob/1.12.2/LICENSE.md).
